# R_Packages
The function of each Package in the list
Downlod and install Eight packages in R studio:
library(adegenet)
library(poppr)
library(dplyr)
library(hierfstat)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(scales)
Why?
We will discuse here the function of each package, even though there ar emulti fucntions for each one, but I will focus on the part that will help in population genetic analysis.
